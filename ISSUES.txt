  * /command:commit may show changes in the same window for the same remote directory:
      WCDIR1/parent_path/ext1
      WCDIR2/parent_path/ext1
    , where ext1 points to the same remote directory.
    Add a flag to split (or do not split) such directories into different lists
    and does show them in separate windows to sequence collided commits.

  * Not unversioned items does filter out now only in window-per-reporoot mode
    what may lead to miss notice records with unversioned/nested status.
    User may forget, for example, to add such items to the version control
    before a commit, so the mode should show these records to notice a user
    about unversioned records around.
