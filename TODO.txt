- Compare saveload file list versus saveload file list

- Add script to read/write file date/times by absolute/relative path list

- Compare 2 panels with selected paths through the read of directory paths
  (file paths compares as is) recursively or not recursively (not applicable
  to archives) with truncated prefix taken from a panel current directory path
  (has meaning compare relative paths instead of absolute).
  Order in which a directory path or file path are read is dependent on a
  panel file arrange order.

- Compare 2 panels with selected paths through the save column details command
  (SAVEDETAILS, applicable to archives) into standalone or arbitrary saveload
  slots including truncation of paths by a prefix taken from a panel current
  directory path (has meaning compare relative paths instead of absolute).

- Add terminal open for bash shell from the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
  (Windows 10+ only).

- Add script to read shortcut files list into a list file with columns:
  `Path|TargetPath|WorkingDirectory`.
  Add script to read a list file with columns to update respective shortcuts.
  Add script to copy shortcut TargetPath from a list.

- Add `SaveLoad -> Add` additionally to `SaveLoad -> Save`

- Add external utilities, plugins and wrapper scripts for:

  * WinMerge as a standalone menu first merge tool:
    https://github.com/WinMerge/winmerge

  * `odiff` to be able to compare images:
    https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff

  * `winmerge2011` to be able to compare SQLite and Excel files:
    https://github.com/datadiode/winmerge2011

  * `autoit` to be able to run AutoIt scripts:
    https://www.autoitscript.com
    https://github.com/AutoIt

    Scripts:

      * `LNKEditorGUI` - GUI to edit windows shortcut files:

  * `Notepad++ MultiRename` plugin to extend `Find and Replace` dialog:
    https://github.com/daddel80/notepadpp-multireplace

- Add Custom Columns variants into Total Commander within tacklebar install.

- Add `Run as...`, `Run in terminal...`, `Run <App>...` menu buttons:

  * `Run in <terminal>...` to run the file under the cursor in a terminal as a
     user.

  * `Run <App>...` to run an application as a user.

  The whole `Run <App>...` menus must has an ability to be partially edited as,
  for example, a yaml file in the Notepad++ editor.

  The users list has to be edited as a standalone list.

  The menu has to be generated for all users from the list.

  , where `Run with...` will ask the rest parameters in a command line
    (`?` character used before the command line).

  NOTE:
    All `Run > ...` items must have has a submenu with `Run >` and
    `Run with...` items to avoid a misclick and ask parameters if required.

  TAGS:
    [log][init]
      Logging is enabled and init made through the `__init__.bat` call in the
      first `cmd.exe` process.
    [nolog][noinit]
      No logging and no init. Fastest startup.
    [noautorun]
      `cmd.exe /D` in the last process.

  NOTE:
    All intermediate `cmd.exe` processes always must use /D (no autorun) flag
    for fastest startup.

  |  |

- VirusTotal triggers on files in `deploy/fonts` directory, remove the files

- Choose to install between the current user and Everyone (all users).

- Add menu refresh for all `git_pull_*.sh` and `git_sync_*.sh` scripts to
  reread the `GIT_REPO_DEFAULT_REMOTES` described in `git_init.sh` script
  from `gitcmd` project.

- Add ffmpeg split by size.
  Size of a file piece can be approximated by time duration of a file piece.
  For example, to split a 6Gb file by 4Gb limit:
    ((4*(1 - <reduce-factor-per-4Gb>))/6) * <duration-msec>

  To avoid a frame freeze in the beginning of each resulting file starting from
  a second one do use split by a key frame:

  To enumerate key frame times:

  > ffprobe -select_streams v -skip_frame nokey -show_frames -show_entries frame=pkt_pts_time,pict_type /PathTo/SourceVideoFilename

  To copy:

  > ffmpeg -i inputfilename -map 0 -ss 60.345678 -to 120.123456 -c copy outputfilename

- Add `contools--recent-lists` project usage

- Extract detection scripts from `._install` directory as a standalone project.

- Open drive root from `mountvol` using `\\?\Volume{...}\` path:
  >
  start /B /WAIT "" "\\?\Volume{...}\"

- Add `TortoiseProc.exe` detection.

- Add Windows Explorer context menu integration.
