- Compare saveload file list versus saveload file list

- Add script to read/write file date/times by absolute/relative path list

- Compare 2 panels with selected paths through the read of directory paths
  (file paths compares as is) recursively or not recursively (not applicable
  to archives) with truncated prefix taken from a panel current directory path
  (has meaning compare relative paths instead of absolute).
  Order in which a directory path or file path are read is dependent on a
  panel file arrange order.

- Compare 2 panels with selected paths through the save column details command
  (SAVEDETAILS, applicable to archives) into standalone or arbitrary saveload
  slots including truncation of paths by a prefix taken from a panel current
  directory path (has meaning compare relative paths instead of absolute).

- Add terminal open for bash shell from the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
  (Windows 10+ only).

- Add script to read shortcut files list into a list file with columns:
  `Path|TargetPath|WorkingDirectory`.
  Add script to read a list file with columns to update respective shortcuts.
  Add script to copy shortcut TargetPath from a list.

- Add `SaveLoad -> Add` additionally to `SaveLoad -> Save`

- Add external utilities, plugins and wrapper scripts for:

  * `odiff` to be able to compare images:
    https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/odiff

  * `winmerge2011` to be able to compare SQLite and Excel files:
    https://github.com/datadiode/winmerge2011

  * `autoit` to be able to run AutoIt scripts:
    https://www.autoitscript.com
    https://github.com/AutoIt

    Scripts:

      * `LNKEditorGUI` - GUI to edit windows shortcut files:
        https://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/151752-lnkeditorgui-windows-shortcut-lnk-link-editor-gui/

  * `Notepad++ MultiRename` plugin to extend `Find and Replace` dialog:

- Add Custom Columns variants into Total Commander within tacklebar install.

- Add optional flag - `-+` to await ONLY not positional parameters until the
  `--` flag.
  Return an error if `--` is not found after `-+` or found more than once.
  Return an error if `-+` is found before `--` more than once.
  Return an error if not a flag parameter is found between `-+` and `--`
  arguments.
  This is useful to accept not positional parameters in the command line as an
  external (expandable) string.

- Add `clearcache.exe <drive>` menu item to clear the drive cache.
  This will clear the drive files cache (release the drive read buffer memory)
  and update the drive connection state (refresh the connection).

- Add a current directory drive `subst` command.
