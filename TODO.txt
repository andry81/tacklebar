- Compare saveload file list versus saveload file list

- Add script to read/write file date/times by absolute/relative path list

- Compare 2 panels with selected paths through the read of directory paths
  (file paths compares as is) recursively or not recursively (not applicable
  to archives) with truncated prefix taken from a panel current directory path
  (has meaning compare relative paths instead of absolute).
  Order in which a directory path or file path are read is dependent on a
  panel file arrange order.

- Compare 2 panels with selected paths through the save column details command
  (SAVEDETAILS, applicable to archives) into standalone or arbitrary saveload
  slots including truncation of paths by a prefix taken from a panel current
  directory path (has meaning compare relative paths instead of absolute).

  * `winmerge2011` to be able to compare SQLite and Excel files:
    https://github.com/datadiode/winmerge2011

  * `autoit` to be able to run AutoIt scripts:
    https://www.autoitscript.com
    https://github.com/AutoIt

    Scripts:

      * `LNKEditorGUI` - GUI to edit windows shortcut files:

- Add optional flag - `-+` to await ONLY not positional parameters until the
  `--` flag.
  Return an error if `--` is not found after `-+` or found more than once.
  Return an error if `-+` is found before `--` more than once.
  Return an error if not a flag parameter is found between `-+` and `--`
  arguments.
  This is useful to accept not positional parameters in the command line as an
  external (expandable) string.

- Add `Run as...` menu button to run the file under the cursor in a terminal:

  Run in cmd.exe terminal...
  Run in MinTTY terminal...
  Run in ComEMU terminal...
  ---
  Run with params in cmd.exe terminal...
  Run with params in MinTTY terminal...
  Run with params in ConEMU terminal...

  , where `Run with params` will ask the rest parameters in a command line
  (`?` character used before the command line).
